Learn to code with us! #FreeCodeCamp #Dhaka cordially invite you.
Meet fellow campers and either work on your own or collaborate with another.
We're all at different stages of learning to code, some absolute beginners and others who know a little more and are able to answer questions. Come code with us! :)
Everyone is welcome
